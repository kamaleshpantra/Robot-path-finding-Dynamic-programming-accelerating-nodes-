# PathOpt: Accelerated Navigation

A path-planning algorithm developed in C++ using Dynamic Programming and Accelerating Nodes to enable efficient robot navigation in dynamic environments. Optimized for rapid blockage detection, alternative path construction, and near-optimal performance.

## Features
- Efficient path planning for robots in dynamic environments.
- Quick detection of blockages with real-time alternative path generation.
- Near-optimal navigation performance using Dynamic Programming.
- Accelerated node-based approach for faster computation.
